In the third task, I created a basic client-server chat application using Java's socket programming API. This was a console-based two-way communication system where the server listens for incoming client connections and the client sends and receives text messages. The application utilizes classes such as Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, and PrintWriter to handle the communication flow. I used Eclipse to develop and run both the server and client applications concurrently. The server is designed to run continuously, waiting for a client connection on a specified port, and upon connection, it handles input and output streams to exchange messages. This task gave me hands-on experience with Java networking, especially the fundamentals of TCP/IP communication. Understanding how to bind to a port, accept connections, and exchange data in real-time is the groundwork for applications like chat apps, multiplayer games, and even command-line remote tools. This task demonstrated the power of Java for low-level network programming and showed how these principles scale up to real-world networked systems.
